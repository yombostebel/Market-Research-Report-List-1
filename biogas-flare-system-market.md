<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Biogas Flare System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open System</li><li>Enclosed System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The biogas flare system market can be categorized into two main types: open systems and enclosed systems. Open systems allow biogas to be combusted in the open air, which is simpler and more cost-effective but may have environmental concerns due to emissions. In contrast, enclosed systems involve combustion within a contained structure, enhancing efficiency and reducing odor and emissions. Both systems aim to safely dispose of excess biogas while minimizing environmental impact, catering to different operational needs and regulations.</p></p>
