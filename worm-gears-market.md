<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Worm Gears Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Enveloping Worm Gears</li><li>Double-Enveloping Worm Gears</li><li>Non-Enveloping Worm Gears</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Worm gears are specialized gear systems used to transmit power between non-parallel shafts. The single-enveloping worm gear features a single helical thread wrapped around the worm, providing efficient torque transfer. Double-enveloping worm gears, which have both a worm and a gear formed with helical surfaces, enhance load capacity and reduce friction. Non-enveloping worm gears, lacking the enveloping design, are simpler but offer lower efficiency and load handling, typically used in less demanding applications. Each type serves distinct industrial needs.</p></p>
